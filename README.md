## Description

This work is a side project I decided to make in order to develop further my React Native skills.
Almana is a conceptual project, the goal is to let you manage tasks and events in the same place so you don't need to use several apps to organise your day.

For more information about the project, you can read the use-case here:

### Features of the project:

:heavy_check_mark: Implementation of Redux. (Redux-thunk, Redux-persist, Redux-offline) <br />
:heavy_check_mark: Implementation of Firebase. (Databse, Authentication) <br />
:heavy_check_mark: Implementation of Reanimated. (60fps UI animation) <br />
:heavy_check_mark: Implementation of Moment.js for date management. <br />
:heavy_check_mark: Implementation of a drag and drop + sort algorithm. <br />

## :bangbang: Notice :bangbang:


Take into consideration that this project **was developed between June and August 2019,** just after I get my React Nanodegree certificate.
At that time I didn't know about **OOP, refactoring, JS Doc or Test-driven development.**

I'm actually working and learning other technologies and going deeper on topics such as OOP with TypeScript, or Node.Js.

So when I'll find some time, I will clean and update the project:

| :white_check_mark:  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|<ul><li>[ ] </li></ul>| Refactors components, have a more "atomic design" approach  |
|<ul><li>[ ] </li></ul>| Refactors the whole Redux logic  |
|<ul><li>[ ] </li></ul>| Improve the Login/Register logic and UI  |
|<ul><li>[ ] </li></ul>| Create a reusable Drag'n'drop component  |
|<ul><li>[ ] </li></ul>| Create an external component to manage notification (RN way to handle notification is quite messy and not adapted to my use case)  |
